# Writing Issues and PRs

Whatever the platform, the writing carries the weight. Stay platform-neutral unless the user or surrounding context calls for platform-specific terms.

For starting structures by scenario (bug report, feature request, PR/MR, work item, review comment), read `references/outlines.md`. Those outlines are examples, not fixed templates: treat them as a starting point and shape the writing to the actual situation — reorder, drop, add, merge, or invent sections as the case demands. Prefer a repo's or tracker's own template whenever one exists.

## Writing principles

- Be concise: omit needless words, cut redundancy and hedging, and prefer plain, direct prose. Make every word count. If it does not fit on one screen, it is too long.
- Be accurate, well-structured, and insightful, in a calm, natural, and human tone. Be skeptical and precise — double-check reasoning, sources, and assumptions.
- State the issue, request, or purpose clearly. Explain why it matters. Include concrete evidence.
- For English prose, follow these style guides, and apply their language-agnostic rules to prose in any language: _The Elements of Style_, _The Sense of Style_, and _Chicago Manual of Style_.

## Formatting rules

- Insert spaces between English words and CJK characters.
- Use `- ` (hyphen plus space) for unordered list items; never use `* ` or `+ `.
- Use `_italics_` for italics and `**bold**` for bold.
- For list items, omit the trailing period when all items are fragments; if any item is a complete sentence, end every item with a period.
- Never use horizontal dividers (`<hr>` or `---`).

### Titles

- Issue and work item titles use "Sentence case" (capitalize the first word only).
- Pull request and merge request titles use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format, following the `git-commit` skill: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`.

### Body headings

- Do not force the text to begin with a heading. Use headings only when they add structural clarity; a short opening sentence or paragraph can come first.
- Use heading levels sequentially (`h2`, then `h3`, etc.); never skip levels.

- Never use `h1`, and never number headings (e.g., `## About me`, not `## 1. About me`).
